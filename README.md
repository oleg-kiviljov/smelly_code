## Project description
As I was struggling with writing clean and maintainable code, I thought it would be nice to have a website where people could put their small && 'smelly' pieces of code and have someone to help them refactor it. This was also one of my earliest experiments with rails.

## Setup
1. git clone https://github.com/oleg-kiviljov/smelly_code.git
2. rake db:migrate
3. rake db:seed
